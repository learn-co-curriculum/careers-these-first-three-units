Congrats on coming this far in the Full Stack Web Development Track. You might still have one or a couple of final assessments to do but we want you to know that once you're done with that and have graduated, you'll go straight into our Career Prep program. 

The following lessons here comprise the first three units of our Career Prep track. Once you've graduated, we'll give you access to the remainder of the track. 

Why do we do it this way? 

Your technical education still isn't over (and of course will always be lifelong) so we want to make sure that your focus is still on building your projects and applications, and mastering Ruby and Javascript. 

That being said, we understand that when you're this close to the end, you'll be curious about placements and what the whole process of landing a job offer entails. Go through the first three units and start to think about your resume, your online profiles, and how you're going to commit to the job search. If you're not ready yet or don't have the time to do the assignments that are in the lessons, don't worry! When you have access to the full track, you can just start there. 

Happy learning!
